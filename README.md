## How to use

There are two different ways you can start the navigation mode. The easiest is by receiving a message with coordinates.
You can simply click the highlighted coordinates to start your journey.

- `/navigate <x> <z>` or `/navigate <x> <y> <z>` to dial in the compass
- `/navigation stop` to stop navigating
